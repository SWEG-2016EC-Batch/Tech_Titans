# Problem Analysis
This program calculates the result of raising a base number to a given power using the mathematical formula:
- Result = Base^Power(x^y)
## Input:
- Base(x): The number that will be raised to the power.
- Power (y): The exponent to which the base is raised.
## Process:
- Compute the result using the formula:
Result=pow(Base, Power)
where the pow function from the <cmath> library performs the calculation.
## Output:
- Display the result of raising the base to the given power in the format:
Base power of Power = Result
